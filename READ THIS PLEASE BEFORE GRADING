Began by trying to implement scripts that werent behaviors
Decided to redo those scripts as behaviors for modularity and efficiency
Built out the Meshes in Blender and imported them into unity
Finished with 2 seperate games with seperate working functions
Merge didnt work as planned
branches finalrobert & FinalMarcus hold the 2 working games

finalrobert holds the working scene switching and the working player controls
FinalMarcus holds the Enemy Spawners, the shooting functionsality, and the working health script

We felt that if we put these 2 together the resulting game would have been decent enough for this evening.
